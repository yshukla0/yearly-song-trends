I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

[Verse 2]
And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned

They wanna plot on my trot to the top

I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

So find someone great, but don't find no one better

Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind

I'm always ready for a war again (A war again)
Go down that road again (That road again)
It's all the same (It's all the same)
I'm always ready to take a life again (That life again)
You know I'll ride again (I'll ride again)
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me? (Who gon' pray for me?)
Take my pain for me? (Take my pain for me?)
Save my soul for me? (Save my soul for me?)

Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today, I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good, then that's what it gotta be

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Sacred prayer and we'd swear

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up

So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me

I don't understand why you blame me
Just take me as I am, it's the same me
We should be (Yeah)
Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see
Ayy

[Verse 1: Drake]
Feelin' young, but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busybody
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott & Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), 29 (Yeah), G5, Seaside

Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Let's go)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my rift
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh) I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]
Woh-oh (Yeah)
Woh-oh, oh-oh (Myke Towers)
Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra)

[Pre-Coro: Sebastián Yatra]
Qué tan loco sería
Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día
Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría
¿Qué pasaría?
Podrías ver entre él y yo quién ganaría

[Coro: Myke Towers & Sebastián Yatra]
Mi condición: enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición me enamoré precisamente de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías

[Verso 1: Myke Towers]
Si me dieran solo veinticuatro hora', yo la' aprovecho
Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho
Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho'
Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo
Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo
Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo
Navaja doble filo
Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo'
Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba
Simplemente todo ahora quedó en la nada
Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba
Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba

[Verso 2: Sebastián Yatra]
Esa minidepresión de ver una foto tuya
Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente
Detente, como dice la canción
Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón
Sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela
Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella

De lo que resultaría
Maldita monotonía

Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (No, oh)
Solo queda ser sincero
